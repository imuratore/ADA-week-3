## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# homework 02

## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
### using a poisson probability distribution to get the upper tail using 9 position along the distribution because that's how I interpretted "more than 8"

ppois(9, lambda=15, lower=FALSE) 

#### returns 0.93 etc, so the answer is a ~93% probability of more than 8 assuming the mean is accurate

## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
### using a poisson probability distribution to get the lower tail using 0 as the position along the distribution

ppois(0, lambda=15)

#### returns 0.0000003059023, so a 0.00003059023% probability, quite unlikely

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
### using a poisson density distribution (since this is just for one specific value) to get the probability of hearing exactly 3 calls

dpois(3, lambda=15)

#### returns 0.0001720701, so 0.01720701% probability, also unlikely

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30
### Using dpois from 0 to 30 and spotting as points over x = a vector from 0 to 30

z <- dpois(0:30, lambda=15)

x <- c(0:30)

plot(x , z, cex = 0.4)

####

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
### 

x <- rpois(104, lambda=15)

set <- NULL  # sets up a dummy variable to hold our 10000 simulations
n <- 104
for (i in 1:104) {
    set[i] <- mean(sample(x, n, replace = TRUE))
}

set

## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

### applying hist() with an x range of 0-30 to "set", which we filled using the bootstrapping loop above

hist(set, xlim=range(c(0:30)))

#### This distribution is much narrower than the one made using the probability mass function. This happens because increasing the sample size or number of simulated values tightens the distribution and decreases variance/standard deviation because n is in the denominator of these equations.

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
