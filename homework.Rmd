## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# homework 02

## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
### using a poisson probability distribution to get the upper tail using 9 position along the distribution because that's how I interpretted "more than 8"

ppois(9, lambda=15, lower=FALSE) 

#### returns 0.93 etc, so the answer is a ~93% probability of more than 8 assuming the mean is accurate

## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
### using a poisson probability distribution to get the lower tail using 0 as the position along the distribution

ppois(0, lambda=15)

#### returns 0.0000003059023, so a 0.00003059023% probability, quite unlikely

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
### using a poisson density distribution (since this is just for one specific value) to get the probability of hearing exactly 3 calls

dpois(3, lambda=15)

#### returns 0.0001720701, so 0.01720701% probability, also unlikely

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30
###



####

##Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
###????????????????????

x <- rpois(10000, 0, 1)

set <- NULL  # sets up a dummy variable to hold our 10000 simulations
n <- 104
for (i in 1:10000) {
    set[i] <- mean(sample(x, n, replace = TRUE))
}

####

## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?
###

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
